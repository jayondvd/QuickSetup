=======================================
QuickSetup Toolkit v1.1
=======================================
This is a little toolkit I made to help in the process of setting up a new project
these are just things I regularly use and got tired of coding over and over.
Inside this note you'll find instructions on how to use all of the features in this
project.
=======================================

=== MUSIC PLAYER ===

The music player is really simple to use. The script for it is located in '_audio'
You can see the details there.

Simply use the Music() function to play music like this

[[[[[
[ 
[ if( playMusic == true )
[	{
[		Music(MySong,Looping,FadeType);
[	}
[ 
[[[[[[

The fade types are as follows-

0 : No Fade (Hard Cut)
1 : Fade In & Out
2 : Crossfade

====================

=== DEBUGGER ===

This is my own 'in-house' tool I use for almost all projects
It lists all rooms in the game (minus 2 characters at the start because of my
own prefix preference for rooms

You can press CTRL to toggle it

There is also a debug screen that toggles an objects name at their origin
You can add information to it in the step event. It displays basic information
such as the build date & time, Game Framerate and Real Framerate, and the current room

It can be toggled with TAB

====================

=== dbg() Script ===

This script is a substitute for show_debug_message & show_message
I got tired of writing them out so I made a script for them. It also displays
the object that's calling it (Note: I have no idea what happens if you call it from 
the script without it being invoked by an object)

====================

=== Camera System ===

If you prefer viewports or just like making your own camera system
you can get rid of this. It just creates a camera at Room Start for
you to use.
